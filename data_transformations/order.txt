definitely should have filtered out the data before decmpounding but here's order of ops i've used:
    (done) decompound
    (done) pull out "words" w spaces
    (done) lemmatize
    (done) pull out numbers
    (done) unfuge candidates added
    (done) reshape
        this step pulls out unused data fields and stores ycs in a dict hashed by base word text
    use only modifier+head pairs? len(splits) == 2
    use only words with at least one coocurrence? count > 1
    pull out named entities (when to perform this step?) - this could perhaps be nullified if we only use defuged modifiers that exist as a lemma in the vocabulary
