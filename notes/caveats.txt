words ending with - were filtered out
    in many cases this eliminates single words split across two lines that were parsed as two words
    however, it also eliminates a certain type of construction, wherein "modifiers" ending with - but separated by spaces are stacked ie
        french- mime-pathogen- experts

NER may remove reasonable compounds such as Turingmaschine and ZÃ¼richstadt

(if i decide to go this route)
for the sake of accuracy, only binary compounds tagged as nouns are considered. decompounders tend to perform better on these
this leaves out accounting for the possibility that ternary+ compounds may have a differend Fn distribution

(if this is true)
Not using rules-based splitter because it relies on a dictionary?? (not totally sure about this)
in which case it would miss lots of words, probably novel words, which this study is interested in

(if i don't do something about this)
hyphen-compounds are not considered.
    it may justifiable to consider this a fugenelement
